## Goal
Build a mobile app that transoforms a paper-based performance evaluation process and digitize it in order to increase manager productivity. 

## Old Process
Managers out in the field had to rely on paper audit sheets when giving performance evaluations to employees. 

### Disadvantages: 
- Printing paper is inefficient  
- Low legibility and accuracy due to handwritten audits
- Paper audits need to be manually filed away
- The employee has no convenient way of receiving a copy of their evaluation

## New Process
Managers out in the field can now use an app to manage their employees and create performance evaluations directly in the app. 

### Advantages:
- No more printing paper
- Increased accuracy due to auto-calc and added photo signature
- Able to archive audits in the cloud
- The employee receives an email of their evaluation.
